In terms of navigation, the customised sidebar has each of the pages in the order that you should most likely read them in. Throughout some of the pages, there are some links that navigate you to any other relevant pages so at times you could read the pages out of order.

THe first [Home](https://github.com/deco3500-2019/FoodForThought/wiki/Home) page contains the promotional material for our project and prototype. The documentation for the High Fidelity Prototype (the final prototype we produced) can be found in the [Final Prototype](https://github.com/deco3500-2019/FoodForThought/wiki/Final-Prototype) page.
